# Minimal EVM squid

This is a starter template of a squid indexer for EVM networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.). See 

To extract EVM logs and transactions by a topic or a contract address, use `EvmBatchProcessor.addLog()` and `EvmBatchProcessor.addTransaction()` methods of `EvmBatchProcessor`, defined in `src/processor.ts`. 

The requested data is transformed in batches by a single handler provided by the `processor.run()` method. 

For a full list of supported networks and config options,
check the [`EvmBatchProcessor` overview](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/) and the [configuration page](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/configuration/).


For a step-by-step migration guide from TheGraph, see [the dedicated docs page](https://docs.subsquid.io/migrate/migrate-subgraph/).

## Quickstart

Install Squid CLI:
```
npm i -g @subsquid/cli
```

Run the indexer and the GraphQL API:
```bash
# 1. Update the Squid SDK and install dependencies
npm run update
npm ci

# 2. Compile typescript files
sqd build

# 3. Start target Postgres database and detach
sqd up

# 4. Start the processor
sqd process

# 5. The command above will block the terminal
#    being busy with fetching the chain data, 
#    transforming and storing it in the target database.
#
#    To start the graphql server open the separate terminal
#    and run. The GraphQL playground will be available at localhost:4350graphl
sqd serve
```

## Dev flow

### 1. Define database schema

Start development by defining the schema of the target database via `schema.graphql`.
Schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives.
Full description of `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](https://docs.subsquid.io/schema-spec).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

Mapping developers use TypeORM [EntityManager](https://typeorm.io/#/working-with-entity-manager)
to interact with target database during data processing. All necessary entity classes are
generated by the squid framework from `schema.graphql`. This is done by running `sqd codegen` command.

### 3. Generate database migrations

All database changes are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`.
`squid-typeorm-migration(1)` tool provides several commands to drive the process.

```bash
## delete all migrations
rm -rf db/migrations/*.js

## drop create the database
make down
make up

## create a new schema migration from the entities
npx squid-typeorm-migration generate      
```

See [docs on schema updates](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/schema-file/schema-updates/) for more details.

### 4. Import ABI contract and generate interfaces to decode events

It is necessary to import the respective ABI definition to decode EVM logs. 

To generate a type-safe facade class to decode EVM logs, place the ABI in the `assets` folder and use `squid-evm-typegen(1)`, e.g.:

```bash
npx squid-evm-typegen src/abi assets/ERC721.json#erc721
```

For more details about `squid-evm-typegen` read the [docs page](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/typegen/squid-evm-typegen/)

## Project conventions

Squid tools assume a certain project layout.

* All compiled js files must reside in `lib` and all TypeScript sources in `src`.
The layout of `lib` must reflect `src`.
* All TypeORM classes must be exported by `src/model/index.ts` (`lib/model` module).
* Database schema must be defined in `schema.graphql`.
* Database migrations must reside in `db/migrations` and must be plain js files.
* `sqd(1)` and `squid-*(1)` executables consult `.env` file for a number of environment variables.

## GraphQL server extensions

It is possible to extend `squid-graphql-server(1)` with custom
[type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com) resolvers and to add request validation. See [the docs](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/graphql-api/custom-resolvers/) for more details.
